# 💊 PharmaTech – AI-Powered E-Health Commerce Platform

**PharmaTech** is an intelligent backend platform for pharmaceutical e-commerce, augmented by a **contextual health guidance chatbot** powered by **Gemini 2.0 Flash** and the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** mechanism.

PharmaTech bridges healthcare and AI by enabling customers to explore medical products, get real-time contextual answers, and make informed purchasing decisions — all while maintaining a strong ethical stance: _AI is advisory, not diagnostic_.

## 🧠 Academic Summary

> **PharmaTech** (Django 5.2, Oct 2025) is a multi-role backend system embedding a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot into a pharmaceutical marketplace. Designed to enhance **accessibility**, **trust**, and **user-centric health guidance**, the system integrates:
>
> - A **Gemini 2.0 Flash** LLM for multimodal health queries (text, prescription images).
> - A hybrid **RAG pipeline** with **ChromaDB**, **web scraping**, and **context-aware prompt engineering**.
> - A layered architecture with role-specific access: customers, distributors, and admins.
> - Real-time interaction via **WebSocket + Firebase Realtime DB**.
>
> The RAG pipeline follows a 3-stage methodology:
>
> 1. **Ingestion**: Asynchronous web scraping from trusted sources (e.g., WHO), Markdown parsing, and vector indexing (10,000 char cap).
> 2. **Retrieval**: Top-K semantic search (k=2) using LlamaIndex + Gemini embedding, constrained to 4,000 chars with up to 4-turn memory.
> 3. **Generation**: Prompting Gemini under ethical guardrails, no-diagnosis instruction, and fallback logic for out-of-domain queries.
>
> ⚠️ All chatbot responses are strictly informational and adhere to ethical LLM boundaries.
